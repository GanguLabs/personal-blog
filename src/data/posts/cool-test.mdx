title: Post with cool component
---

import Boxes from "../../pages/labs/playground/box-example";

This is an my second post.

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `mdx-bundler`.

Now I will render a cool component from the same folder.

I'm also using custom Link Component

Go back [home](/).

<Boxes color="#a3f3ff" />
