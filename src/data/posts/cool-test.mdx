title: Post with cool component
---

import { FullBleed } from "../../layouts/PostLayout.tsx";

This is an my second post.

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `mdx-bundler`.

Now I will render a cool component from the same folder.

I'm also using custom Link Component

Go back [home](/).

`{/* <FullBleed><p>This is a test</p></FullBleed> */}`
